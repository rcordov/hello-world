just another repository to be used to teach myself

edit number 2 is to be made

Made this edit in get hub, testing what will happen when we pull from origin


I have created a branch, and edited that file, now I want to see what
will happen when this file is edited on master.


well make sure to cause a conflict when pulling from github

made this change on branch clean_up

made changes to readme while on clean_up branch

another change onto this file, from clean_up, also checking if I have to stage
a file everytime I need to commit
	YES
